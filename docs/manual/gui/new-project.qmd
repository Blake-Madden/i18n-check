# Working with Projects

To create a new project, click the `r keys("New")` button on the ribbon.
The **New Project** dialog will appear:

First, select which folder (or file) you wish to analysis.
If analyzing a folder, you can also optionally select subfolders and files that should be ignored.

Next, select which source code checks to perform from the **Source Code** page.
(Documentation for these options is available in ch. [-@sec-gui-settings].)

Next, options for performing checks on translation catalogs and creating pseudo-translated resources are avaible on the **Resource Files** page:

Finally, the **Additional Checks** page provides checks unrelated to i18n or l10n, such as code formatting and file encoding issues.

Once finished selecting your options, click `r keys("OK")` to create the project.

After opening or creating a project, you can reanalyze the folder at any time by clicking `r keys("Refresh")` on the ribbon.
The **Edit Project** dialog will appear, where you will be able to change any option before re-running the analysis.

When you are finished reviewing a project, click `r keys("Save")` to save it.
The project file will remember the folder you were reviewing, along with your current settings.
To reopen this project, click the `r keys("Open")` button on the ribbon and select the project file.
